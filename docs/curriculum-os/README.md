# Jewble Curriculum OS (February 2026 Consolidation)

This package mirrors Jewble's existing product filing logic into a curriculum-ready operating structure for schools.

## One organism, three audience layers

Jewble should be presented through **layered revelation**:

- **Students (Kids):** "This is your companion pet."
- **Teachers:** "This is lessons, routines, and reflection language."
- **Leadership / ICT:** "This is privacy, safety, and low overhead implementation."

This avoids product fragmentation: one core system, different audience framing.

## Add-on strand: architecture curriculum (older students / enrichment / teacher PD)

Optional extension modules:

1. **Privacy by design**
   - offline-first operations
   - no tracking / no analytics dependency
   - auditable network behavior

2. **Identity without surveillance**
   - on-device cryptographic DNA identity primitives
   - uniqueness and verification without exposing private student data

3. **Trust UX patterns**
   - calm-first mechanics
   - anti-addiction design signals
   - reflection-forward interaction loops

Use this strand as enrichment, teacher PD, or upper-grade digital citizenship/STEM crossover.
