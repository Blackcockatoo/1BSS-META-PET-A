# Jewble Meta-Pet: 7-Day Sprint Checklists (Execution-First)

Use this as a no-overwhelm operating sheet. Pick one lane per week and execute end-to-end.

## Ruthless priority stack (default)

1. ICT proof pack + pilot stability
2. Teacher kit polish
3. Outreach cadence + tracking
4. Landing page + demo convenience
5. Regulator submission packaging

## Lane A — Pilot Delivery (School-ready in 7 days)

**Outcome by Day 7:** a teacher can run the 2-week pilot with zero surprises, ICT can verify offline status quickly, and recovery paths are obvious.

### Day 1 — Lock core classroom reliability
- Add/verify **Classroom Mode** defaults (fast start, reduced clicks, predictable session timing).
- Add/verify **Teacher Controls**: reset pet, pause/sleep, end-session ritual, volume/mute, brightness-friendly mode.
- Define acceptance checks for low-spec devices (old laptop, Chromebook, tablet baseline).

### Day 2 — Offline proof in-product
- Build a visible **Offline Verified** panel/state.
- Add a built-in self-check screen that confirms no active network dependency.
- Draft short ICT validation text (DevTools + firewall confirmation).

### Day 3 — Save resilience hardening
- Validate failure-proof save behavior (interrupted close/reopen, storage edge cases).
- Add a clear **restart without loss** flow.
- Add recovery messaging for corrupted/invalid state fallback.

### Day 4 — Classroom UX polish
- Add projector-friendly view mode for whole-class facilitation.
- Run accessibility pass: high contrast, reduced motion, keyboard navigation, dyslexia-friendly typography option.
- Time-box each pilot interaction loop to match 20-minute lesson windows.

### Day 5 — Teacher kit usability test
- Dry-run all 7 sessions internally at 20 minutes each.
- Tighten facilitation scripts where pacing slips.
- Finalize printable worksheets and troubleshooting one-pager.

### Day 6 — ICT confidence package
- Finalize 1-page network audit quickstart.
- Finalize architecture sheet (offline-first, no SDKs/analytics/accounts).
- Finalize crypto identity explainer + threat model lite + privacy policy URL.

### Day 7 — Pilot readiness review
- Run a complete install -> launch -> session -> save -> relaunch -> reset test.
- Verify teacher-facing docs match actual UI labels/actions.
- Freeze a pilot build and publish distribution links.

## Lane B — School Outreach (Pipeline discipline in 7 days)

**Outcome by Day 7:** outreach operations become measurable, consistent, and follow-up-driven.

### Day 1 — CRM hygiene reset
- Normalize status taxonomy: `NEW -> SENT -> FOLLOW-UP DUE -> RESPONDED -> MEETING -> PILOT RUNNING -> DONE`.
- Add principal name and direct email fields.
- Add owner + next action + due date fields per row.

### Day 2 — Template system
- Create message templates by context: cold, warm intro, follow-up, ICT-forward.
- Add subject line variants and CTA variants (meeting vs pilot invite).
- Add copy snippets for privacy-proof objections.

### Day 3 — Follow-up automation
- Add follow-up cadence columns (Day 7 / Day 14 / final bump).
- Add conditional formatting for overdue follow-ups.
- Add quick filters for `FOLLOW-UP DUE` and `MEETING`.

### Day 4 — KPI panel
- Add dashboard cells: emails sent, responses, meetings booked, pilots started, conversion %.
- Add weekly trend row and target row.
- Add source tagging (cold outbound, referral, inbound).

### Day 5 — Batch send day
- Send first structured batch with template tracking.
- Log every send immediately with timestamp + template used.
- Queue follow-up tasks at send-time (not later).

### Day 6 — Response handling and booking
- Process replies into categories: positive, soft no, hard no, ICT request.
- Trigger ICT-forward pack for technical stakeholders.
- Confirm meetings with agenda + pilot prerequisites.

### Day 7 — Review and iterate
- Review conversion by template and audience.

- Confirm tone: practical safeguards over marketing language.

### Day 2 — Compliance-by-design annex
- Build checklist mapping product design choices to risk reduction.
- Include explicit no-collection/no-tracking controls.
- Include verification steps for third-party assessors.

### Day 3 — School evaluation framework
- Draft “how schools can evaluate ed-tech architecture” reference sheet.

- Add pass/fail style criteria for procurement teams.

### Day 4 — Zero-collection reference implementation
- Document architecture pattern and implementation boundaries.
- Clarify what never leaves device and why.
- Add concise technical diagrams or flow bullets.

### Day 5 — Regulator pack versioning
- Create versioned regulator pack separate from school pitch assets.
- Add changelog section for updates after policy/news events.
- Ensure language consistency across submission and annex.

### Day 6 — External review prep

## End-of-week decision gate

At the end of each sprint, decide one of three moves:
- **Ship**: lane goals met, proceed to next priority lane.
- **Stabilize**: keep same lane for another week with narrowed scope.
- **Escalate**: unblock with external support (ICT reviewer, legal, deployment help).
