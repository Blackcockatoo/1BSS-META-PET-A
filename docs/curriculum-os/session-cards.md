# Jewble Pilot Session Cards (7 Sessions / 2 Weeks)

Each card defines: **objective -> script beats -> student artifact -> evidence captured**.

---

## Session 1 — Meet the Companion (Cause & Effect)
**Objective:** establish the pet-care loop and basic system responsiveness.

**Script beats (20 min):**
1. Introduce companion framing and care actions.
2. Demonstrate one action and resulting state change.
3. Guided pair practice.
4. Quick reflection close.

**Student artifact:**
- "What I changed and what changed back" mini reflection.

**Evidence captured:**
- participation pulse
- first-use confidence markers
- beginner systems-language (cause/effect words)

---

## Session 2 — Wellbeing Routines (Self-Regulation Vocabulary)
**Objective:** connect repeated routines to calmer outcomes and emotional naming.

**Script beats (20 min):**
1. Recap prior care loop.
2. Introduce calm mechanics and routine consistency.
3. Small-group routine planning.
4. Exit reflection prompt.

**Student artifact:**
- personal routine card ("When X, I do Y").

**Evidence captured:**
- use of self-regulation words
- routine consistency observations
- teacher-noted behavior transfer cues

---

## Session 3 — Values Mapping (Choices and Consequences)
**Objective:** map school values to in-game care decisions.

**Script beats (20 min):**
1. Surface 2–3 school values in plain language.
2. Model one value-driven choice.
3. Teams classify care actions by value.
4. Share-outs.

**Student artifact:**
- values map: "This care choice shows ____ because ____."

**Evidence captured:**
- value-language usage frequency
- quality of reasoning in explanations
- peer discussion quality markers

---

## Session 4 — Reflection Conversion (Gameplay -> Language Data)
**Objective:** convert interaction into reflective, transferable language.

**Script beats (20 min):**
1. Explain reflection as evidence, not judgment.
2. Prompt students to narrate one moment of adaptation.
3. Structured writing or voice capture.
4. Pair feedback loop.

**Student artifact:**
- short reflective statement with evidence sentence.

**Evidence captured:**
- reflection completeness
- specificity of observed behavior change
- emotional vocabulary breadth

---

## Session 5 — STEM Lens (Homeostasis + Data Literacy)
**Objective:** reveal system balancing and simple data interpretation.

**Script beats (20 min):**
1. Introduce homeostasis as balance over time.
2. Observe pet state changes and infer patterns.
3. Build one "if/then" model from observations.
4. Group debrief.

**Student artifact:**
- mini systems model (state -> action -> result).

**Evidence captured:**
- systems-thinking language
- ability to identify trends
- prediction accuracy (basic)

---

## Session 6 — Student Showcase (Explain Your System)
**Objective:** demonstrate ownership through explanation and demonstration.

**Script beats (20 min):**
1. Prepare one-minute explainers.
2. Showcase in pairs/small groups.
3. Structured peer questions.
4. Capture key insights.

**Student artifact:**
- showcase card (system, routines, what improved).

**Evidence captured:**
- communication clarity
- rationale quality
- peer-feedback quality

---

## Session 7 — Debrief + Evidence Pack
**Objective:** consolidate pilot evidence for teacher and leadership review.

**Script beats (20 min):**
1. Student final reflection (what changed in me/how I learn).
2. Teacher compiles evidence templates.
3. Class-level pattern identification.
4. Close-out summary and next-step recommendation.

**Student artifact:**
- final reflection snippet for evidence pack.

**Evidence captured:**
- engagement trends across 2 weeks
- wellbeing-language progression
- teacher implementation feasibility notes

---

## Implementation notes

- Default pacing: ~20 minutes each session.
- Delivery model: **I do -> We do -> You do**.
- Pilot posture: low-friction and classroom-safe.
