# ICT / Leadership Audit Sheet ("Verify in Minutes")

Use this checklist during pilot approval and implementation review.

## A. Delivery fit (operational overhead)

- [ ] Pilot can run in 2 weeks / 7 sessions.
- [ ] Session duration fits timetable (~20 min).
- [ ] No mandatory account provisioning workflow.
- [ ] No mandatory data-export workflow for basic use.
- [ ] Classroom setup steps are documented for non-technical staff.

## B. Privacy posture (school-safe baseline)

- [ ] Learner use does not require personally identifying student data.
- [ ] Data handling guidance is available for alias-based classroom practice.
- [ ] Privacy summary can be shared with leadership and guardians.
- [ ] Retention/reset expectations are clearly documented.

## C. Network behavior verification (ICT quick check)

- [ ] Verify no required outbound network calls during core pilot usage.
- [ ] Confirm behavior via browser developer tools network panel.
- [ ] Run spot-checks during launch, interaction, and reflection flows.
- [ ] Record timestamp + tester + result in implementation log.

### Suggested quick protocol
1. Open application in browser.
2. Start network inspector (filter to XHR/fetch/ws).
3. Run one complete mini-flow (open -> interact -> reflect).
4. Confirm no unexpected outbound requests required for operation.
5. Save screenshot/log entry for governance record.

## D. Technical spine confirmation (for ICT/dev reviewers)

- [ ] Offline-first behavior is documented.
- [ ] Persistence model is documented (local/browser-side storage).
- [ ] Identity model summary is documented at high level.
- [ ] Architecture explanation is available for technical due diligence.

## E. Evidence and reporting readiness

- [ ] Teacher evidence templates are available before pilot starts.
- [ ] Session artifacts map to reporting outcomes.
- [ ] Leadership summary template is pre-filled as a pilot shell.
- [ ] Parent comms template is prepared for rollout context.

## F. Sign-off snapshot
